# Fine-Tuning LLMs with LoRA

Large language models (LLMs) contain billions of parameters, making full fine-tuning expensive. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** offers a practical alternative by introducing small trainable matrices that adapt pretrained weights without updating them directly.

## Why LoRA?

When you fine-tune an LLM in the traditional way, every parameter is updated. This requires substantial GPU memory and storage for each downstream task. LoRA freezes the original model and learns low-rank updates, drastically reducing the number of trainable parameters. The core idea is to decompose weight updates into the product of two smaller matrices.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify target layers** – Typically the query, key, and value projection matrices in transformer blocks.
2. **Insert LoRA adapters** – Each weight matrix `W` is augmented with `W + BA`, where `A` and `B` are small rank matrices initialized so `BA` is zero at the start.
3. **Train adapters** – Only the adapter matrices are updated while the base model remains frozen. After training, `BA` can be merged into `W` for inference.

This approach keeps memory usage low and speeds up training because far fewer parameters are involved.

## Tips for Success

- **Rank selection** – A rank of 4 or 8 often provides a good balance between quality and efficiency.
- **Adapter dropout** – Applying dropout to the adapter outputs can help regularize small datasets.
- **Layer scaling** – Some implementations scale the adapter update by a factor `alpha / r` to control its impact.

## Conclusion

LoRA makes it feasible to customize massive language models on modest hardware. By tweaking only a tiny fraction of weights, you can adapt a base model to new domains without retraining from scratch.
